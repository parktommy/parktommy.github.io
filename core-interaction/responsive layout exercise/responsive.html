  <h1>Mark Zuckerberg Has a Lot of Homework to Do</h1>
  <h2>In two days on Capitol Hill, the Facebook chief promised numerous
    lawmakers that he would get back to them with answers to their questions.
    We counted up that workload.</h2>

  <p>Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg —
    or perhaps more accurately, members of his staff —
    are going to be very busy getting through a stack of homework.</p>
  <p>Over two days of Congressional hearings this week in which Mr. Zuckerberg was barraged with
    questions by lawmakers over data privacy, election interference and more,
    the 33-year-old billionaire was often not able to provide an immediate answer.
    His standard response in those situations,
    a variation of “my team will get back to you,” was repeated so often it became an internet meme.</p>
  <p>Here are all the things that Mr. Zuckerberg has committed to getting back to Congress on. Yes, it’s a long list.</p>
  <p>Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get back to Mr. Grassley on whether his team finds any new examples
    in which user data was improperly transferred to a third party in breach of Facebook’s terms of service.
    He also said he would get back to
    Mr. Grassley on how many outside developers his team has audited to make sure they are following Facebook’s rules.</p>
  <p>Mr. Zuckerberg said he would follow up with Ms. Feinstein on the exact number of fake accounts Facebook has removed from the social network.

Role with Cambridge Analytica and Donald J. Trump’s campaign
Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get back to Ms. Cantwell on whether Facebook
employees ever worked with Cambridge Analytica to help the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.</p>
